# Company

Module group `company`. 19 screens in the standard menu.

## Behaviours

- The company's name, address, tax ID and phone are preferences printed on every document; the base currency's symbol prefixes every amount.
- Branches tag documents and journal lines inside one set of books; every document carries a branch (the user's default branch to start) and reports filter by branch. One default branch always exists; the Branches screen shows when Multiple branches is on.
- Departments and projects are optional (each its own switch under Preferences → Features, off to start). Departments form a tree, each inside a parent or at the top; a project names an optional customer, start and end dates and a status (planned, active, finished, cancelled). Both tag documents and their journal lines (fixed assets, transfers and opening balances excepted); a department or project in use cannot be deleted, only deactivated or finished. Switched off, the pickers and filters go and the tags already booked stay.
- Tax codes carry a rate and the accounts for tax on sales and purchases; a code may compute its base as a fraction of the price (the 12 % VAT whose base is 11/12 of the price is the seeded default). Prices on a document are entered including or excluding tax, per document.
- Payment terms name a due period in days, an early-payment discount and its window; chosen per customer or vendor and per document.
- Shipping methods and FOB terms are masters chosen on orders and deliveries.
- Employees are the salespeople named on sales documents, customers and commissions. With the payroll module on, an employee's Pay tab holds the salary components paid every month and their amounts, BPJS participation (health; employment: old-age savings, work accident and death; pension) and the work-accident rate of their risk group; the Income tax tab holds the PTKP status, the month tax counting starts and any net income and tax from an earlier employer that year; an exit date ends payroll after that month. Salary components each name an income kind (salary, allowances, overtime, bonus, employer-paid insurance, employee contributions, deductions), which decides whether it is taxed, on which A1 row it falls, and whether it is paid, deducted or owed to a fund.
- Recurring transactions make their document (journal voucher, payment or receipt) on schedule; memorized transactions are templates filled in by hand. The calendar shows what falls due: receivables, payables, maturing giros, recurring runs, notes and month end, by month, by week, or as an agenda of the next 30 days.
- Month-end process closes months in order; a closed month refuses any addition, change or deletion dated in it, on the old and the new date of an edit; reopening takes a special right and is audited.
- The activity log is the append-only record of who did what, with the document's revisions before and after each change.
- Currencies carry their decimals (none for the rupiah, two for the dollar) and a table of rates, each from a date: rupiah per one unit, and the Minister of Finance's weekly rate for VAT when it differs. A document takes the latest rate on or before its date. Foreign currencies are offered on documents only while Multiple currencies is on and a foreign currency is active; without one, nothing on any screen changes.
- Website (Central) is where the Owner overrides what the public site says: contact details, the about texts, the partners, the roadmap and the values the legal pages cite, each in Bahasa Indonesia and English. A value left as written in the client config is not stored; a changed one is, and every change is audited with the value before and after. The public site reads the stored value first and the config otherwise; the two legal pages stay Indonesian whatever the visitor chose.
- Website Images (Central) holds the pictures the public home page shows: a promo is a slide of the carousel with a title, a text and a link; a photo goes in the gallery with its caption. An image shows while active and within its dates, in its order; the file lives on the public disk under promo/.
- The bell (Central): the staff panel shows database notifications, polled every minute; a module's reminders (the delivery watch, counts due, birthdays, the month to close) arrive there and by mail in the company's language, to the administrators, a customer's team or a role. A module may add its own kinds of event to the Calendar; they join the legend.
- Year-end Close (Central) is a lock, not a posted closing entry. The Owner closes a fiscal year once its checklist stands: every month of the year is closed, depreciation is posted for every month an active asset was in use, the year's two semester count sheets are approved, and the ledger integrity sweep finds nothing; the screen shows each item's state and what is still open. A month inside a closed year never reopens on the Month-end Process; the Owner reopens the year first, with a reason, latest year first. Closing and reopening are audited. The balance sheet keeps computing retained earnings from the books as the base does, so no jurnal penutup is posted. Finance reads the screen.
- The month to close (Central): when the next month to close is more than ten days past (`central:books-reminder`, every morning), Finance and the administrators get a bell and a mail pointing at the Month-end Process, once per month. The calendar marks the fiscal year's end for whoever may open the Month-end Process.
