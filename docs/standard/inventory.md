## Behaviours

- Central's list prices are versions (Price List): an upload of the supplier's workbook (read by position, category and product type from the nearest title row, the brand from its column; what cannot be trusted is blocked, what was guessed is annotated) or of the company's own format (the export) is parsed in the background, diffed against the list in force (new, changed with old and new, unchanged, not in the file, errors; the biggest moves), held by the safety brake when more than a fifth of the prices move or one moves by more than half, and published as the next version in one transaction: items named are created or refreshed, items not named keep their price (switched off only when the file is a full replacement), earlier versions are superseded and the item's cached selling price refreshed. A version is never edited; the export of the list in force is the import format.
- Central: one warehouse, one account. An administrator binds a member of the Warehouse group to one warehouse (Warehouse Accounts), which puts the account in the warehouse's branch; a warehouse holds one active account, a hand-over deactivates the old one first, and reactivating it next to the new one is refused. Fulfilment lists the approved orders the warehouse holds goods for in the stock reservations ledger, with a pick list and Deliver, which makes the delivery in the account's name for what is held, never more; the holds are consumed and the delivery prints as the surat jalan. A bound account sees its own warehouse and nothing else; Inventory and the Owner pick a warehouse.
- Stock is per warehouse; cost is a moving average per item per warehouse. Every movement carries its document's date; a back-dated or edited document recosts what came after it, never before the first open period.
- Items are of four types (inventory, non-inventory, service, group) with any number of units and conversion ratios, a selling price per price category, a purchase price, default accounts, a tax code, a minimum stock and an opening stock per warehouse. A group item (bundle) keeps no stock of its own: selling, delivering or taking back a group moves its stocked components (quantity per group unit, in each component's unit), each at its own cost and on its own inventory and cost of sales accounts. Groups are sold, never bought, received or counted.
- Adjustments change quantity and/or value per warehouse against an adjustment account, and record opening stock. Transfers move goods between warehouses with an in-transit stage. Stock opname orders a count per warehouse; the result is compared with the system and its variance posted as an adjustment, approved by someone other than the counter.
- Order fulfilment shows what is ordered and not yet delivered, and what stock on hand and open purchase orders cannot cover ("need to order", the earliest orders served first); stock by warehouse the quantity and value per item per warehouse.
- Minimum stock lists the items at or below their minimum: the warehouse's own minimum when one is set on the item, else the item's overall minimum. Beside stock on hand it shows what approved, open purchase orders still bring (on order) and what approved, open requisitions still ask for (requested), and the quantity to order to get back to the minimum. Selected items open a purchase order (their preferred vendor, when they share one) or a requisition with those lines.
- With departments or projects on, inventory adjustments carry a department and a project on the header and per line, so a write-off reads against the department that made it. Transfers between warehouses carry none.
- Stock Age (Central) reads how old the stock on hand is from the ledger: every receipt opens a layer dated the day it entered the warehouse (a transfer's goods on the receive date, a return on its date, opening stock on its date; a value adjustment opens none), every issue takes the oldest layers first, and what remains is the stock on hand with its age; one row per item and warehouse with the oldest layer, the quantity in each bucket (0–30, 31–90, 91–180, 181–365, over 365 days) and the value at the average cost. A gudang account sees its own warehouse; the value needs the "see cost" right. Nothing is stored; the books keep their moving average.
- Count Sheets (Central) are the counts on a cadence: every working evening `central:opname-sheets` drafts, per warehouse, a Stock Opname Order of kind daily and its result holding only the SKUs that went out of that warehouse that day (the system quantity snapshotted as the base's Pull does); on the first day of January and July a semester sheet holds every SKU the warehouse has had. Sheets are written in the System user's name (no person holds its password; under segregation of duties it never approves). The gudang counts its own warehouse's sheets on the screen; Purchasing approves, which posts the variance as the base does. `central:count-reminders` every morning tells the gudang and Purchasing of sheets past their day not yet counted, and Purchasing of counts waiting for approval, by bell and mail; sheets due show in the calendar. A manual count still lives on the base's Stock Opname screens.
- Damaged goods (Central): a return claim line is good or damaged; the filer suggests, the verifier decides. A damaged line enters the branch's damaged-goods warehouse (Gudang Rusak, one per cabang, flagged "damaged goods"; verification refuses without one) and the customer is credited in full as for any return. Damaged stock never counts as available to the portal, the reservations or the order splitter, and the Fulfilment screen never ships from it. Damaged Goods lists what sits there with its age and the return it last came from; Purchasing writes it off (a negative inventory adjustment on the loss account, 6600 Damaged Goods Loss by default, made in the chart when missing) or returns it to the vendor by hand.
