# Reports

Module group `reports`. 6 screens in the standard menu.

## Behaviours

- Every report in the catalogue takes its filters (period, branch, and the report's own), is computed from the journal and the stock ledger when it opens, and exports to Excel. Nothing is stored.
- With departments or projects on, the income statement and the general ledger also filter by department (the department with every department under it) and by project. The balance sheet and the other reports stay whole-company.
- The VAT return summarises output and input tax per tax period, headed by the company's VAT identity (registered name, tax ID, VAT registration number and date, business type, KLU). The Income Tax Art. 21 Return shows a month's payroll per employee (taxable gross, TER category and rate, tax withheld) and exports the month's BPMP slips for Coretax's import; Withholding Slips shows each employee's A1 for a year (income by the slip's rows, occupational cost, pension contributions, PTKP, taxable income, the year's tax and what was withheld), prints it, and exports the A1 slips of the employees whose year or employment ended. Each export is kept as a filing numbered from the withholding-slip series and can be downloaded again. A2 (civil servants) does not apply.
- The balance sheet shows the income of fiscal years before the current one as retained earnings and the current fiscal year's as "Net income this year"; the fiscal year starts in the month Preferences name. The income statement, statement of changes in equity and cash flow open on the fiscal year to date; the other reports on the current month.
- Receivable and payable aging use the buckets Preferences set (an interval up to a range, then everything older: current, 1–30, 31–60, 61–90 and over 90 days to start) and age from the invoice date or the due date as Preferences say, which a report may change.
- Aging and the customer and vendor statements include opening balances, aged from their own invoice date. A statement shows the balance brought forward, then every invoice or bill, down payment, opening balance, return and receipt or payment in the period, with the running balance owed; a bounced giro counts for nothing.
- Receivable and payable aging and the customer and vendor statements take a Currency filter while foreign currencies are in use: left empty, every document in rupiah (as without currencies); a currency, only its documents in its own amounts.
- Product Analytics (Central) is six views over one set of filters (period, branch, warehouse, category, brand), read from the invoice lines, the return lines, the stock movements and the stock cache: most sold (ranked by quantity, net value or distinct customers, with the cost of what left and the margin), least taken (stock on hand with no delivery in the last 30, 90, 180 or 365 days), never sold, oldest stock, most returned (returned against sold, the rate), turnover (units sold against the stock on hand, months of cover). Cost and margin need the "see cost" right; Excel export needs the export right; the top ten of the view draws as bars.
- Neraca and buku besar (Central) are the Balance Sheet and the General Ledger of this catalogue, with the account history; Finance holds every report. The customer's debt in every report ages from the day the order was accepted (the acceptance clock, Sales).
