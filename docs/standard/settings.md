# Settings

Module group `settings`. 10 screens in the standard menu.

## Behaviours

- Preferences the release does not use yet (attachments, extra columns, financial categories, employee loans, the temporary payment account) are not offered on the screen; a stored value is kept. The company's fax prints on the letterhead; the data start date is the first day anything can be dated and the default date of opening balances.
- Number and date formats (the Other tab): the number convention (1.234.567,89 or 1,234,567.89) governs every amount shown and typed; quantities show up to the chosen decimals; unit prices on printed documents the chosen decimals; date fields use the chosen date format, while tables keep "17 Oct 2026".
- Language (the Other tab): the screens come in English or Bahasa Indonesia; the company's choice is everyone's default, and each user may pick their own on their profile (the avatar menu → Profile). Documents sent to customers (the tax invoice email and its PDF) go in the company's language. Month names and table dates follow the language; number and date formats are their own preferences. The template ships `lang/id.json` and `lang/id/*.php`; a client's own strings go in `app/Client/lang`.
- Preferences are the one source of truth for every switch: the company's identity, the modules that are on, the default accounts the posting layer uses, the business rules, the aging basis, the attachments and extra columns. Every change is audited with the old and the new value.
- Users are never deleted: they are deactivated, which stops sign-in at once (a session already open ends at its next click, back on the sign-in page with the reason) and keeps their name on everything they entered, approved or changed. Deactivating is refused for yourself, for the last active administrator, and for anyone an approval still needs: a named approver on an approval rule, the only active member of an approving group, or the person a waiting document cannot be approved without. Replace them on the rule first; a document already half approved waits for them to decide, or is edited so it asks again under the current rules. Reactivating restores access.
- The activity log records that a hidden field changed (a two-factor secret, recovery codes) but never its value; passwords and remember tokens are not logged.
- Access is by group: each group holds the five rights (view, create, update, delete, print) per screen plus the special rights (see cost, change selling price, see credit data, override credit limit, open a closed period, back-date, edit others' transactions, delete posted transactions, approve transactions, export). A user belongs to groups, may carry per-user grants or revocations, and is limited to the branches and warehouses assigned to them. A group's rights can be copied from another group.
- The special rights are enforced: without "see credit data" the customer's credit limits, the overdue notice on sales documents and the exposure in the approval prompt are hidden (stored values are kept); without "back-date" a document cannot be saved dated before today, or moved there (editing it on the date it already has is allowed); without "delete posted transactions" a posted document cannot be deleted and its Delete button is hidden; without "export" reports and the VAT return have no Export button.
- Branch limits: a branch closed to all users is open only to the users assigned to it. A user limited this way sees only the records of their branches (and those tagged to no branch) on every screen, may book only into their branches, and runs reports for one of their branches instead of all.
- The access window: an administrator may always work; an operator may when any of their groups allows the moment, either by the group's own time window or, for groups that follow Preferences, by the Restrictions tab (not restricted, restricted for everyone, or a time window). A window whose end is before its start runs past midnight. Outside it every page answers "access closed" with the hours.
- Seeded groups: only Administrator and Accounting may back-date and delete posted transactions.
- Six groups are seeded (Administrator, Accounting, Finance, Sales, Purchasing, Warehouse); the client reshapes them on the Access Groups screen.
- Numbering is configured per document type: a pattern of tokens (prefix, year, month, counter), the counter width, and when it resets; several series per type, one of them the default, each limited to chosen users or open to all.
- Print layouts are designed per document type: which blocks print, the heading, the footer, paper and orientation; one default per type.
- Approval rules (Transaction Approvers) say which documents need approval, from what amount, in which branch, for whose entries, by whom (users or groups) and under which condition: any one approver; at least two different people; every approver in any order; every approver in a set order. A group's place is filled by any one of its members. Only the document types a module registers are offered: quotations, orders, deliveries, invoices and returns on both sides, requisitions, goods receipts, vendor claims and payments, cash and bank vouchers and transfers, journal vouchers, expense accruals, inventory adjustments, item transfers and stock counts.
- One approval engine serves them all. At every save a document gets a request: approved on the spot when no active rule covers it, otherwise waiting under the covering rule with the highest "from amount". Sales orders wait only while the Sales Order Approval rule is on, and stock counts always wait; without a covering rule anyone with the "approve transactions" right approves them. The person who entered a document never approves it while Segregation of Duties is on, and each approval of a sales order passes the credit check.
- A waiting or rejected document is still in the books, but nothing is made from it (no Pull, no Process), it does not print, and no payment settles it. An edit that changes the amount, the branch or the lines asks for approval again; a note does not. Until someone decides, a request follows rule changes; decisions only ever grow.
- Seeded: inactive rules for sales returns, purchase returns and vendor claims, approved by any one member of Accounting.
- Operations (Central) is how the box stands now, for the administrator: the seven health checks (the database, Redis, the queue, failed jobs, the scheduler's heartbeat written every minute, the age of the last off-site backup, the disk), each healthy, warning or critical by thresholds in the client config; the backups (never, failing, stale, local or ok) with the last ten runs; and the ledger integrity findings, every cache read against its ledger. The hourly sweep (`central:health --alert`) mails every active administrator and the extra address once per critical incident, throttled for six hours and re-armed when the box recovers; the nightly sweep (`central:integrity --notify`) mails the findings while a drift stands and repairs nothing. A backup can be asked for from the screen; the worker takes it. The Security watch card is the last day of the Activity Log read by the same rules the ten-minute sweep (`central:security-watch --alert`) applies: passwords guessed from one address or against one account, an administrator signing in from an address not seen in ninety days, rights or memberships changed or a user made administrator, Segregation of Duties switched off, a price list published over the safety brake, a posted receipt whose amount, date or customer changed, a receipt or invoice deleted outside business hours; with the failed sign-ins of the day per guard and the last ten staff sign-ins with their address. Every sign-in attempt on either guard is a row of the Activity Log (`login_failed` with the email tried, `login_succeeded` with the user) and one JSON line in the security log; each finding is reported once per six hours for the same subject, by mail and, once a provider is configured, by WhatsApp. `central:backup` dumps the database, encrypts it and the kept files, stores them on the configured disk, reads every artefact back before calling the run verified, and prunes past 14 daily and 12 monthly copies, never the newest; `central:restore --into` is the drill into a scratch database, and the live database is restored only with `--force`.
- Launch Readiness (Central) lists what still stands between the system and going live: eleven items the system checks on every read (the production environment, mail, the company identity, the site's contact details and partners, a published price list, staff passwords, the administrators' second factor, an off-site backup, ledger integrity, a real approved invoice) and six a person attests with their name, the date and the evidence (PSE registration, KBLI, the legal pages reviewed, the commercial values, the invoice format, the restore drill); attestations are administrators' only, audited and withdrawable with a reason. `central:launch-check` is the same list on the command line and exits 0 only when nothing is outstanding; the deploy script prints it after every release.
