# Public site — design

Sub-project 5 of `docs/ROADMAP.md`. Status: approved 2026-10-13; built 2026-10-13.

## Goal

The company's open, indexed site: who Central is, what it carries, where its branches
are, how to become a customer, and the way in to the portal and the admin. Bilingual
(Indonesian first, English second), never a price, two legal pages that stay Indonesian.
The previous system had it (commit `0683d20`): eight pages under Indonesian slugs, a
`bahasa` cookie, a nonce CSP, robots and sitemap, a promo carousel from a JSON setting,
Owner overrides of the copy, and a nearest-branch finder from browser geolocation. The base
has no public routes (`/` redirects to `/admin`), a global `SecurityHeaders` middleware
that can only be tightened, `Locales`, `CompanyIdentity::letterhead()`, branches with
coordinates, and an unused `resources/css/app.css`.

Decisions with the user: **no nearest-branch finder** (a buyer's branch is set by the
admin; the portal shows unified, global stock), so no geolocation and no base edit; Owner
copy in a **client table behind a Website screen**; promos in a **table with image upload
and optional dates**; **no public catalogue**.

## 1. Routes and middleware (`app/Client/Site`)
- `app/Client/routes/site.php`, loaded by `ClientServiceProvider::boot()` inside an
  `$this->app->booted()` callback, after the base's `routes/web.php`, so the site's `/`
  replaces the base redirect (same method and URI: the later route wins). Controllers,
  never closures (`route:cache` in deploy). Group: `web` + `SiteLocale` +
  `SiteContentSecurityPolicy`; names `site.*`.
- Pages: `/` home, `/tentang-kami` about, `/mitra` partners, `/rencana-pengembangan`
  roadmap, `/kontak` contact (every active branch: name, address, phone, hours, a map
  link built from its coordinates), `/kebijakan-privasi`, `/syarat-penjualan` (both
  Indonesian whatever the cookie), `/masuk` sign-in chooser (portal login, admin login).
  `/bahasa/{kode}` (`id|en`) sets the `bahasa` cookie for a year and redirects to the
  referer when it is on this host, else `/`. `/robots.txt` (allow all, disallow
  `/admin`, `/portal`; sitemap link) and `/sitemap.xml` (the eight pages, `lastmod` =
  the latest site setting or promo change) as routes; the 0-byte `public/robots.txt` is
  removed so the route answers.
- `SiteLocale`: `Locales::apply($request->cookie('bahasa') ?: 'id')`; `<html lang>` and
  the copy follow it. The legal pages render through `Locales::using('id', …)`.
- `SiteContentSecurityPolicy`: a second, stricter policy on the site's responses
  (`default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:;
  font-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; form-action 'self';
  base-uri 'self'; object-src 'none'`). Two policies are both enforced, so the site runs
  under the tighter one with no inline script and no inline style: the carousel, the
  mobile menu and the language switch live in `resources/js/site.js` (bundled by Vite);
  JSON-LD is a data block CSP does not execute. The base header stays as it is.

## 2. Layout and design
- `resources/views/client/site/layout.blade.php` + one view per page under
  `resources/views/client/site/`. `resources/css/site.css` (Tailwind 4, `@source` the
  site views and `site.js`, Geist from `@fontsource-variable/geist`, tokens from
  DESIGN.md as `--color-*` variables, dark through `prefers-color-scheme`). Both Vite
  inputs added to `vite.config.js` (build configuration, as the portal theme was).
  `resources/css/app.css` stays untouched.
- Head: title, meta description, canonical, Open Graph, `favicon.svg` (a plain mark
  under `public/`), JSON-LD `Organization` with the branches as `location`. No third-party
  asset; motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion`. Built with the design skills
  (`impeccable`, `make-interfaces-feel-better`, `transitions-dev`).
- Every string the site shows is either company copy (a pair) or UI chrome through
  `__()`; copy is echoed with `{{ }}` so `TranslationGuardTest` sees no bare text.

## 3. Copy and the Owner's overrides
- `app/Client/config/site.php`: the company's copy as `['id' => …, 'en' => …]` pairs
  (tagline, about, why-us points, brands and categories blurbs, partner types, roadmap
  items, hours, contact, the legal values the terms cite: credit days, late payment, return
  window, delivery), merged as `site`. `App\Client\Site\Copy`: `text(key)`, `list(key)`,
  `pair(key)` in the current locale; a pair is an array keyed only `id`/`en`.
- `site_settings(key pk, value jsonb, updated_by, updated_at)`: the Owner's values,
  overlaid on the config by `App\Client\Site\SiteSettings` (`get`, `set` with
  `Auditor::log('site_setting_changed')` before/after). Cached per request; a change
  bumps the sitemap `lastmod`.
- Screen **Website** (`client__website`, Modul::Company, Setup): a page whose form has
  tabs Contact (phone, WhatsApp, email, city, hours id/en), About (short name, tagline,
  summary and profile, id/en), Partners (repeater: name, country, since, field and
  description id/en), Roadmap (repeater: title and description id/en, status), Legal
  (identity and the values the two legal pages cite). Saves through `SiteSettings`; a value
  put back to the config's own is forgotten. Administrator only.
- `SiteCopyTest`: every pair in the config has both sides non-blank; a setting overrides
  the config; the rendered English page shows the English side.

## 4. Promos and photos (the user's note: any picture, the goods or anything)
- One table, `site_images(id, kind promo|photo, title jsonb {id,en}, text jsonb {id,en},
  image_path, link, is_active, show_from, show_until, sort, timestamps)`, `RecordsActivity`.
  Image on the `public` disk under `promo/` (`storage:link` in `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`
  and `docs/DEPLOY.md`; sub-project 6 carries it into the deploy kit). `SiteImage::live(kind)` =
  active and today within the dates (null = open), by `sort`.
- Screen **Website Images** (`client__site-images`, Modul::Company, Setup): `ManageRecords`
  over the table: kind, image upload (jpg/png/webp, 2 MB, with the editor), titles in both
  languages, a promo's text and link, active, dates, order. Administrator and Marketing ALL.
- The home renders the live promos as the carousel (one slide needs no script; `site.js`
  rotates several, pauses on hover and focus, stops under reduced motion) and the live
  photos as a gallery with captions. The sitemap's `lastmod` is the latest setting or image.

### Home, revised 2026-11-06

The hero is one dark card (`--ae-rail-bg`), left-aligned, "Become a customer" first and a generic bearing drawing
beside the words. One slot sits under it. Live promos take it, each an Instagram post (best 1080 × 1350, 4:5; 1:1
and 3:4 fit) shown whole and never cropped, with its title, text and end date beside it as text, and the
categories stand as cards below. With no live promo the categories take the slot as a carousel under a tab strip,
so a category never shows twice. Previous and next stand on the slide's left and right edges. The brand list left
the home (it stays on the about page) and the roadmap left the header (it stays in the footer). Promos carry no
rupiah figure: the site never shows a price, and the page's test cannot read the inside of an image, so the
Website Images screen says so. Parallax is CSS only (DESIGN.md, Motion).

Merged the same day with the landing page work of `2026-11-04-landing-page-design.md`: its glance, portal showcase, FAQ,
WhatsApp button and cookie notice stay. The glance stands as a card under the hero, and the faint mark behind the
hero gave way to the bearing.

### Inner pages, revised 2026-11-06

About, Partners, Contact and Roadmap open on a shorter dark card with one generic drawing: a hydraulic cylinder, a
damper, a spark plug and a bearing. Legal pages and sign-in keep the plain heading. On About the profile and the
company's details share one split card, the categories stand in a row of plates, the audience in three cells and the
steps on one joined line, and the page closes on the blue band. Partners take a tile of their initials until they
carry logos, and "Work with us" becomes the blue band. The FAQ is one split card with its first answer open. No copy
changed.

## 5. Portal: global stock (the user's note)
- `Reservations::availableAnywhere(itemId)`: on hand minus held, summed over active
  warehouses. `CartEstimate::availability()` and the Catalogue badge read it instead of the
  home warehouse (the order still ships from the home warehouse and is split at approval
  when the goods sit elsewhere). `CartTest`/`CatalogueTest` adjusted.

## Base edits (listed)
None in code. `public/robots.txt` removed (static file would shadow the route);
`vite.config.js` gains the two site inputs; `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` gains
`storage:link`.

## Order of work (TDD per step, commit per step)
1. Spec; commit.
2. Routes, middleware, layout, the eight pages with config copy; `SiteRoutesTest`
   (every page 200 in both languages, no `Rp` and no price anywhere, legal pages
   Indonesian under the `en` cookie, `/` no longer redirects, the second CSP header,
   robots and sitemap), `SiteLanguageTest` (cookie, on-host redirect only).
3. Settings table, `SiteSettings`, Website screen; `SiteCopyTest`, `WebsiteScreensTest`.
4. Promos table, screen, carousel; `PromoTest`.
5. Portal global stock; tests.
6. Design pass with the skills (both themes, phone width, reduced motion), `site.js`,
   favicon, smoke; notes, `erp:standard`, i18n scripts, full suite, Pint, build;
   roadmap row; commit; push.

## Verification
- `php artisan test`, `vendor/bin/pint --test`, `php artisan erp:standard --check`,
  `npm run build`, `npm run smoke -- /` and `/kontak`.
- Manual: open `/` in Indonesian, switch to English, every page follows except the two
  legal pages; no price on any page; the Owner changes the phone on Website and the
  contact page shows it; a promo with an image and a date range appears on the home only
  inside the range; `curl -I /` shows two CSP headers; `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml`
  answer; a buyer's catalogue badge says Available for stock held in another branch.
